<p>A&nbsp;<strong>Banarasi saree</strong>&nbsp;is a saree&nbsp;made in Varanasi, an ancient city which is also called&nbsp;Benaras/Kashi/Banaras. During the Mughal period around the 14th century, the artisans from banaras started making their presense by developing unique and complicated silk brocades using the gold and silver zari threads. Banarasi&nbsp;<a href="https://www.silkkothi.com/blogs/silk-kothi-blogs/weavers-a-prized-possession-from-archaic">weaving</a>&nbsp;started getting more recognition and developed expertise during the 18th and 19th century. These sarees are among the finest sarees in India&nbsp;and are known for their gold and silver brocade or zari, fine silk and opulent hand weaving. The sarees are made of finely woven silk&nbsp;and are decorated with intricate design, and because of these engravings,&nbsp;banarasi silk sarees have made a prominent place and flourished in the market.</p>
