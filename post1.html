<p>There are two distinctive styles of Kalamkari art in India â€“&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srikalahasti_Kalamkari">Srikalahasti style</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedana_Kalamkari">Machilipatnam style</a>. The Srikalahasti style of<em>&nbsp;Kalamkari</em>, where the "<em>kalam</em>" or pen is used for freehand drawing of the subject and filling in the colors, is entirely hand worked. This style flourished in temples centered on creating unique religious identities, appearing on scrolls, temple hangings,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_car">chariot</a>&nbsp;banners as well as depictions of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity">deities</a>&nbsp;and scenes taken from the Hindu epics (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana">Ramayana</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purana">Purana</a>). The style owes its present status to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamaladevi_Chattopadhyay">Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay</a>&nbsp;who popularized the art as the first chairperson of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Handicrafts_Board">All India Handicrafts Board</a>.</p>

They illustrated their accounts using large bolts of canvas painted on the spot with simple means and dyes extracted from plants.
